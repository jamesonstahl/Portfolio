# COVID-19 Risk Assessment
This program runs users through a series of health assessment questions to determine their risk for COVID 19. There is a person class that keeps track of the users
personal information that is inputted, list of COVID symptoms or pre existing conditions, and a risk counter. A users risk for COVID-19 is determined by the users
state, age, and COVID symptoms or pre existing conditions. 

The libcurl library is used to implement thevirustracker API to extract and display current COVID-19 data.
